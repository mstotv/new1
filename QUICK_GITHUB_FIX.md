# üöÄ Quick GitHub Upload Fix

## The Problem
Railway can't find your Python files because they're only on your computer, not on GitHub.

## Easy Solution (Web Upload - No Commands Needed!)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the green "New" button (or "+" ‚Üí "New repository")
3. Repository name: `telegram-social-media-bot`
4. Make it **Public** (required for Railway free tier)
5. **DO NOT** check "Add a README file"
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Upload Your Files
1. On the new repository page, click "uploading an existing file"
2. Open your file explorer to: `C:\Users\SABAH\Desktop\telegram_downloader_bot`
3. Select ALL files (Ctrl+A) EXCEPT the `.git` folder
4. Drag and drop them into the GitHub upload area
5. Scroll down and click "Commit changes"

### Step 3: Fix Railway
1. Go back to Railway and delete your current failed project
2. Click "New Project" ‚Üí "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select your `telegram-social-media-bot` repository
4. Railway will now see all your Python files!
5. Add your environment variables:
   - `BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token`
   - `CHANNEL_ID=@mitakurd`
   - `CHANNEL_USERNAME=mitakurd`

## ‚úÖ This Will Fix The Error
Railway will now see:
- main.py ‚úÖ
- requirements.txt ‚úÖ
- railway.toml ‚úÖ
- All other files ‚úÖ

Instead of just README.md ‚ùå

## üéØ Result
Your bot will deploy successfully on Railway!
